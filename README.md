# AndroidMapApp

This project works with the main activity calling an asyn task wherein you get the jsonArray as a result.
THis result is used in creating a listview displaying all the hostels Available.Once an Item is clicked ,it goes to a map activity and 
a marker is shown at the clicked location..

Still needed to be updated..
